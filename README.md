## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:
### For X-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select X-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to X-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## For Y-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select Y-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to Y-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## For Z-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select Z-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to Z-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## For Complete-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select Complete-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to Complete-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
###   1.	Move the x-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the x-axis assembly.
###   2.	Move the y-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
###   3.	Move the z-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

## OUTPUT:

### X-AXIS ASSEMBLY:

### SMOOTH ROD:
    provide smooth, consistent motion when paired with linear bearings.
### BEARING:
    bearing refers to a mechanical component used to reduce friction and facilitate smooth movement between two or more parts
### IDLER:
    an idler refers to a component that is responsible for guiding and tensioning a filament during the printing process.
### EXTRUDER:
     A filament feeding mechanism used in many fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printers
### MOTOR:
     used to move the extruder or the build platform alone the x, y, and z axis.


### Y-AXIS ASSEMBLY:

### Y-AXIS SUPPORTER:
    Y-axis supporter refers to a structural component that provides support and stability to the Y-axis motion system.
### HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL THREADED ROD:
    The horizontal threaded rod is often used to control the movement along the X-axis or Y-axis in a 3D printer.
    The vertical threaded rod is used for controlling the movement along the Z-axis in a 3D printer.
### SMOOTH ROD:
    provide smooth, consistent motion when paired with linear bearings.
### PULLEY:
    a small mechanical device used to help guide and position the print head.
### MOTOR:
    used to move the extruder or the build platform alone the x, y, and z axis.
### Y-AXIS FRAME:
    Y-axis frame refers to the structural component that supports and holds the Y-axis motion system. The Y-axis is one of the three primary axes in a 3D printer, responsible for the movement of the print bed or build plate in the horizontal direction perpendicular to the X-axis.
### Y-AXIS BASE:
