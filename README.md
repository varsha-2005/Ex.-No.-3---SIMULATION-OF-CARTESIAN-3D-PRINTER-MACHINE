SMOOTH ROD:
    provide smooth, consistent motion when paired with linear bearings.
    
BEARING:
    bearing refers to a mechanical component used to reduce friction and facilitate smooth    movement between two or more parts
    
IDLER:
    an idler refers to a component that is responsible for guiding and tensioning a filament during the printing process.
    
EXTRUDER:
     A filament feeding mechanism used in many fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printers
     
MOTOR:
     used to move the extruder or the build platform alone the x, y, and z axis.


### Y-AXIS ASSEMBLY:

Y-AXIS SUPPORTER:
    Y-axis supporter refers to a structural component that provides support and stability to the Y-axis motion system.
    
HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL THREADED ROD:
    The horizontal threaded rod is often used to control the movement along the X-axis or Y-axis in a 3D printer.
    The vertical threaded rod is used for controlling the movement along the Z-axis in a 3Dprinter.
    
SMOOTH ROD:
    provide smooth, consistent motion when paired with linear bearings.
    
PULLEY:
    a small mechanical device used to help guide and position the print head.
